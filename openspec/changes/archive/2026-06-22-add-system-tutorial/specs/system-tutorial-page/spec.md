## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Tutorial page section navigation

`tutorial.html` SHALL provide a navigation component (`.tutorial-nav`) listing one anchor link per content section (`.tutorial-section`). Each anchor's `href` SHALL match the `id` of its corresponding section exactly. Clicking a navigation link SHALL scroll the page to that section, and scrolling the page through a section SHALL mark its corresponding navigation link as active by toggling an `.active` class, with at most one navigation link active at a time.

#### Scenario: Clicking a navigation link scrolls to and highlights its section

- **WHEN** a user clicks a `.tutorial-nav` link with `href="#dashboard-flow"`
- **THEN** the page SHALL scroll so the `<section id="dashboard-flow">` is in view
- **AND** the clicked link SHALL receive the `.active` class while all other `.tutorial-nav` links lose it

#### Scenario: Scrolling through sections updates the active navigation link

- **WHEN** a user scrolls the page so `<section id="export-flow">` enters the viewport
- **THEN** the `.tutorial-nav` link with `href="#export-flow"` SHALL receive the `.active` class
- **AND** the previously active link SHALL lose the `.active` class

### Requirement: Tutorial content coverage

`tutorial.html` SHALL contain sections documenting: a system overview, local startup instructions (`python3 -m http.server`), the CSV column schema and one example row for each of the three templates (`timeline`, `headline`, `template3`), the Dashboard Google Sheets connection flow, template/split-mode switching, and the 2× JPG export flow. The export section SHALL state that fixed-size 1200×1200px cards are downloaded as 2400×2400px `image/jpeg` files named `card-{n}.jpg`. Each template's section SHALL list its CSV columns and at least one example row consistent with that template's `COLUMNS` definition in `src/templates/`.

#### Scenario: Each template section lists its CSV columns and an example row

- **WHEN** the tutorial page renders the section for a given template
- **THEN** that section SHALL list the template's CSV column names
- **AND** SHALL show at least one example row using those column names

##### Example: Template CSV columns shown in their sections

| Template | CSV columns | Example row source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| timeline | 年代,時間,內文 | `missions/2026_美伊戰爭大事記/` data |
| headline | 年代,標題,時間,小標,內文,資料來源,更新時間 | `missions/2026_柯文哲案大事記/` data |
| template3 | 年代,標題,時間,小標,內文,資料來源,更新時間 | `missions/2024_南韓戒嚴大事記/` data |

#### Scenario: Export section documents the current JPG output

- **WHEN** a user reads the tutorial's `export-flow` section
- **THEN** the section SHALL describe 2× JPG export, 2400×2400px output for fixed-size cards, and the `card-{n}.jpg` filename pattern

### Requirement: Tutorial discovery links on existing entry pages

`index.html` SHALL provide a visible link to `tutorial.html` within `.toolbar-actions`, and `dashboard.html` SHALL provide a visible link to `tutorial.html` within `.toolbar`. Neither link SHALL reuse an existing element `id`, and adding it SHALL NOT rename, remove, or change the behavior of any existing toolbar element.

#### Scenario: index.html toolbar link navigates to the tutorial page

- **WHEN** a user clicks the tutorial link in `index.html`'s `.toolbar-actions`
- **THEN** the browser SHALL navigate to `tutorial.html`

#### Scenario: dashboard.html toolbar link navigates to the tutorial page

- **WHEN** a user clicks the tutorial link in `dashboard.html`'s `.toolbar`
- **THEN** the browser SHALL navigate to `tutorial.html`

### Requirement: No regression to existing page behavior

Adding `tutorial.html` and its discovery links SHALL NOT alter the existing behavior of template rendering, CSV parsing, pagination, JPG export, or the Dashboard's spreadsheet-loading flow. `index.html` and `dashboard.html` SHALL continue to function exactly as before for all controls other than the newly added link.

#### Scenario: index.html and dashboard.html function unchanged after the tutorial link is added

- **WHEN** `index.html` is opened with an existing mission and `dashboard.html` is opened with an existing spreadsheet
- **THEN** template switching, split/single mode switching, refresh, export, and the Dashboard's sheet/tab selection SHALL behave exactly as they did before this change
